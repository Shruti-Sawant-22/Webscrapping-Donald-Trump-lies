# Webscrapping-Donald-Trump-lies

## About the Data: 
On July 21, 2017, The New York Times updated an opinion article called Trump's Lies, detailing every public lie the President has told since taking office. Because this is a newspaper, the information was of course published as a block of text. This is a great format for human consumption, but it can't easily be understood by a computer. In this webscraping project I will extract the President's lies from the New York Times article and store them in a structured dataset.

## What is web scraping?
It's the process of extracting information from a web page by taking advantage of patterns in the web page's underlying code. Let's start looking for these patterns!

## Steps:

1.Examining the New York Times article

2.Examining the HTML
- Fact 1: HTML consists of tags
- Fact 2: Tags can have attributes
- Fact 3: Tags can be nested

3.Reading the web page into Python

4.Parsing the HTML using Beautiful Soup

5.Collecting all of the records

- Extracting the date
- Extracting the lie
- Extracting the explanation
- Extracting the URL

6.Beautiful Soup methods and attributes

7.Building the dataset

8.Exporting the dataset to a CSV file 

9.Applying a tabular data structure
